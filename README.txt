Lists is a Homey app built around a dashboard widget that lets you view and manage your lists directly from your home screen. Create shopping lists, task lists, or simple notes—everything stays visible at a glance without needing to open a separate app.

The app supports multiple lists with custom icons and colors, item categories, quantities, due dates, and person assignments. You can mark items as complete, add notes, and manage everything with swipe gestures. Lists also integrates with Homey flows, so you can add or remove items automatically based on events in your smart home.
